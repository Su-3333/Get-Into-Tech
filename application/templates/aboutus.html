<h1>About Digital Health</h1>
<h3>Our Mission</h3>
<p> The Digital Health platform is designed to be an oasis for you in the busy digital world you navigate. We want you
to be able to have constructive time online, away from work and social media. The aim is for you to be able to
track your progress, see what is working well for you, and regain balance with how you are spending your time and
    energy.</p>

<h3>Reflect</h3>
<p>Use our journal feature to take the time to reflect on what is going on for you. Take time to be mindful and track
your habits in order to have a better understanding of yourself and where you want to go. </p>
<h3 id="discover">Discover</h3>
<p>We have constant access to all the negative things happening in the world. It can be overwhelming to be consuming
a disproportionate level of news covering suffering. Refill your cup by focusing on some of the progress being made,
the small wins and incremental positive change we should also be aware of. </p>
<h3 id="strengthen">Strengthen</h3>
<p> Practice and habit are key to developing your inner strength. Use the digital health platform to cultivate
and improve that growth and development. </p>
<h3 id="relax">Relax</h3>
<p>How much time are you taking to unwind? Take a look at some of our resources to see how you could treat yourself to
more relaxation time. </p>
<h3 id="share">Share</h3>
<p>The next iteration of Digital Health aims to bring the community together. We want you to share what is working for
you and learn from others too. You will be able to read other member's journal entries, comment and share media
and suggest themes and tips to each other. </p>
